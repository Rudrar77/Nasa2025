            Hi there! My name is <span className="text-primary font-bold">Flare</span>, and I'm a solar flare! 
            I was born from the incredible energy of our Sun, 93 million miles away from Earth.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base mb-4">
            Solar flares like me are bursts of energy that shoot out from the Sun's surface. 
            We're made of super hot particles and magnetic energy that can travel really, really fast through space!
          </p>
          <p className="text-base">
            Today, I'm going to take you on an amazing journey to show you what happens when 
            space weather like me travels toward Earth. Are you ready for an adventure?

            <span className="text-secondary font-bold">Space weather</span> is what we call all the 
            activity that happens between the Sun and planets like Earth.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base mb-4">
            Just like Earth has weather with rain, snow, and wind, space has its own weather! 
            This includes solar flares like me, something called coronal mass ejections (CMEs), 
            and the solar wind - streams of particles flowing from the Sun.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base">
            Even though the Sun is super far away, our space weather can affect lots of things 
            on Earth in ways people might not even realize!

          </p>
          <p className="text-base mb-4">
            It usually takes me about 8 minutes for my light to reach Earth, but my particle energy 
            takes longer - sometimes a few hours or even days depending on how strong I am.

          </p>
          <p className="text-base mb-4">
            Those are called auroras (or northern and southern lights)! They happen when particles 
            like me interact with Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere. It's like nature's own light show!

          <p className="text-base">
            Earth has an invisible protective shield called a magnetosphere that deflects most space weather. 
            But sometimes, when solar flares like me are really strong, we can still cause some effects!
